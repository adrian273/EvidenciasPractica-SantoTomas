<strong>Affirmation of Individual Rights of Persons Receiving Services</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Grievance Resolution for Persons Receiving Services</u></strong></p>
<p>Each person has the right to raise complaints or grievances. Beat to your Rhythm LLC will assist persons in understanding this right and the process for making a grievance known upon entering services. The person making the grievance may do so in writing or verbally to the Owner, Director of Services, or any Managing Member of Beat to your Rhythm LLC. Making a complaint or grievance will not prejudice any future services or supports and the affected individual will not suffer any negative effects due to filing a complaint. Beat to your Rhythm LLC will ensure that no individual shall be coerced, intimidated, threatened or retaliated against because the individual has exercised his or her right to file a grievance or has participated in the grievance process. Every effort will be made to resolve the concern at the earliest stage and in a fair manner.</p>
<p>Beat to your Rhythm LLC will provide this grievance process to the person receiving services and/or the individual&rsquo;s guardian or authorized representative in a manner understandable to all at the time that service begins, during the month of January for each year of continued services, when there is a change to the procedure, or upon request.</p>
<p>Complaints and grievances may be about services, supports, contractors, employees or other areas that are not covered by the Dispute Resolution Procedure.</p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;When someone wishes to make a grievance or complaint, they may do so in writing or verbally to Beat to your Rhythm LLC. If a verbal complaint is made to Beat to your Rhythm LLC, the complaint will be put in writing by the Owner, Director of Services, or any Managing Member for Beat to your Rhythm LLC for follow-up.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Beat to your Rhythm LLC will ensure that a written log is kept which tracks the complaint and its resolution.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;The Owner or Director of Beat to your Rhythm LLC will try to resolve the complaint to the satisfaction of all parties as soon as possible. If an immediate resolution is not possible, Beat to your Rhythm LLC will offer an opportunity for all parties to come together to try to find a mutually acceptable solution. All parties will be informed about a meeting time and place at least 10 days before the meeting unless everyone involved wants to meet sooner.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Mediation may be used if both parties voluntarily agree to this process.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Beat to your Rhythm LLC will make all attempts to resolve the complaint within fifteen (15) days following any conversation or meeting.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Beat to your Rhythm LLC will ensure that agreements are documented and all involved parties receive copies of the decisions made during discussions, meetings or mediation, should they wish.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;If the complaint or grievance cannot be resolved, and Beat to your Rhythm LLC&rsquo;s Owner has not been involved to-date, the complaint may be submitted to the Owner for consideration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Complainants that feel their complaints cannot be resolved through these procedures can submit them to the Health Facilities and Emergency Medical Services Division (HFEMSD) Home and Community Services complaint line, in person, mail or email. The division encourages complainants to try to resolve concerns first through Beat to your Rhythm LLC&rsquo;s grievance process, as this is often the quickest way to address the problem. If concerns cannot be addressed satisfactorily through these more informal processes or the complainant chooses not to utilize Beat to your Rhythm LLC&rsquo;s grievance processes, the complainant may file a formal complaint with the division.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Dispute Resolution for Persons Receiving Services</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Persons receiving services, parents, legal guardians, or authorized representatives (if within the scope of their duties) shall be offered a means for resolving disputes when one or more of the criteria listed below is met. The use of this procedure will not prejudice the future provision of services and supports to the individual receiving services.

This is a function of the local CCB and/or the Division of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (DIDD). In decisions that affect Medicaid Eligibility, Beat to your Rhythm LLC will educate you regarding your right to appeal and what steps are necessary to follow in order to process a claim, should the need arise. Generally, the Case Management representative at the appropriate CCB will be contacted in order to file a formal appeal when decisions are made that impact your Medicaid Waiver Eligibility, or reduction in allocated/funded service units.</p>
<p>Decisions made by Beat to your Rhythm LLC management and/or administration which impact your services and supports will be handled according to this Dispute Resolution policy and procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Beat to your Rhythm LLC makes a decision affecting services and supports, as defined above, Beat to your Rhythm LLC will ensure that a written notice of action is provided to you, in accordance with the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing Rule 8.605.2 A-J, accompanied by this procedure to inform you of decisions proposed and to help you determine whether you want to contest or appeal the decision. The notice must be provided to you, in writing, at least fifteen (15) days before the action is to be effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have been notified by Beat to your Rhythm LLC that it intends to take action that can be disputed, and you disagree with that action, you have the right to an appeal or complaint. The complaint should be in writing to the Managing Members of Beat to your Rhythm LLC, and Beat to your Rhythm LLC will respond with further explanation of the process that is to be followed, if you wish to file a formal complaint.</p>
